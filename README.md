# Maternal Health Risk Analysis
Insufficient knowledge about maternal healthcare during and after pregnancy is a leading cause of death among pregnant women due to complications. It is essential to monitor every moment of pregnancy to ensure the healthy development of the fetus and safe delivery. Adequate care and diagnosis at the start of pregnancy can significantly reduce preventable deaths of pregnant women and newborns, particularly in rural areas.

The notebook aims to examine various factors that impact the health of pregnant women and develop a machine learning model to predict the level of health risk for pregnant women.
